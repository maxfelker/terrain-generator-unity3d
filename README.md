Unity3D Terrain Generator 
---

Simple perlin noise based terrain generator for Unity 3D.

This project is intended to be a starting point for procedural Unity 3D terrain generation.  It uses some standard Unity 2019.3 assets and should work out of the box but no promises.

### Fork me, patch me, make me better! 
This code was originally proof-of-concept code I cobbled together from a tutorial or gist (?) in 2016. I have yet to find the original source which is built ontop of LibNoise.Unity. If you or someone you know recognizes the source, please let me know so I can provide credit. _\*unsolved mysteries theme intensified\*_
